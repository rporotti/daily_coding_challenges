#### Problem 200

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Let `X` be a set of `n` intervals on the real line. We say that a set of points `P` "stabs" `X` if every interval in `X` contains at least one point in `P`. Compute the smallest set of points that stabs `X`.

For example, given the intervals `[(1, 4), (4, 5), (7, 9), (9, 12)]`, you should return `[4, 9]`.

#### Problem 201

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an array of arrays of integers, where each array corresponds to a row in a triangle of numbers. For example, `[[1], [2, 3], [1, 5, 1]]` represents the triangle:

```
  1
 2 3
1 5 1
```

We define a path in the triangle to start at the top and go down one row at a time to an adjacent value, eventually ending with an entry on the bottom row. For example, `1 -> 3 -> 5`. The weight of the path is the sum of the entries.

Write a program that returns the weight of the maximum weight path.

#### Problem 202

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Write a program that checks whether an integer is a palindrome. For example, `121` is a palindrome, as well as `888`. `678` is not a palindrome. Do not convert the integer into a string.

#### Problem 203

This problem was asked by Uber.

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the minimum element in `O(log N)` time. You may assume the array does not contain duplicates.

For example, given `[5, 7, 10, 3, 4]`, return `3`.

#### Problem 204

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes in faster than `O(n)` time. Recall that a complete binary tree has every level filled except the last, and the nodes in the last level are filled starting from the left.

#### Problem 205

This problem was asked by IBM.

Given an integer, find the next permutation of it in absolute order. For example, given `48975`, the next permutation would be `49578`.

#### Problem 206

This problem was asked by Twitter.

A permutation can be specified by an array `P`, where `P[i]` represents the location of the element at `i` in the permutation. For example, `[2, 1, 0]` represents the permutation where elements at the index `0` and `2` are swapped.

Given an array and a permutation, apply the permutation to the array. For example, given the array `["a", "b", "c"]` and the permutation `[2, 1, 0]`, return `["c", "b", "a"]`.

#### Problem 207

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Given an undirected graph `G`, check whether it is bipartite. Recall that a graph is bipartite if its vertices can be divided into two independent sets, `U` and `V`, such that no edge connects vertices of the same set.

#### Problem 208

This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

Given a linked list of numbers and a pivot `k`, partition the linked list so that all nodes less than `k` come before nodes greater than or equal to `k`.

For example, given the linked list `5 -> 1 -> 8 -> 0 -> 3` and `k = 3`, the solution could be `1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 8 -> 3`.

#### Problem 209

This problem was asked by YouTube.

Write a program that computes the length of the longest common subsequence of three given strings. For example, given "epidemiologist", "refrigeration", and "supercalifragilisticexpialodocious", it should return `5`, since the longest common subsequence is "eieio".
