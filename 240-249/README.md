#### Problem 240

This problem was asked by Spotify.

There are `N` couples sitting in a row of length `2 * N`. They are currently ordered randomly, but would like to rearrange themselves so that each couple's partners can sit side by side.
What is the minimum number of swaps necessary for this to happen?

#### Problem 241

This problem was asked by Palantir.

In academia, the h-index is a metric used to calculate the impact of a researcher's papers. It is calculated as follows:

A researcher has index `h` if at least `h` of her `N` papers have `h` citations each. If there are multiple `h` satisfying this formula, the maximum is chosen.

For example, suppose `N = 5`, and the respective citations of each paper are `[4, 3, 0, 1, 5]`. Then the h-index would be `3`, since the researcher has `3` papers with at least `3` citations.

Given a list of paper citations of a researcher, calculate their h-index.

#### Problem 242

This problem was asked by Twitter.

You are given an array of length 24, where each element represents the number of new subscribers during the corresponding hour. Implement a data structure that efficiently supports the following:
* `update(hour: int, value: int)`: Increment the element at index hour by value.
* `query(start: int, end: int)`: Retrieve the number of subscribers that have signed up between start and end (inclusive).
You can assume that all values get cleared at the end of the day, and that you will not be asked for start and end values that wrap around midnight.

#### Problem 243

This problem was asked by Etsy.

Given an array of numbers `N` and an integer `k`, your task is to split `N` into `k` partitions such that the maximum sum of any partition is minimized. Return this sum.

For example, given `N = [5, 1, 2, 7, 3, 4]` and `k = 3`, you should return `8`, since the optimal partition is `[5, 1, 2], [7], [3, 4]`.

#### Problem 244

This problem was asked by Square.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm used to generate all prime numbers smaller than N. The method is to take increasingly larger prime numbers, and mark their multiples as composite.

For example, to find all primes less than 100, we would first mark `[4, 6, 8, ...]` (multiples of two), then `[6, 9, 12, ...]` (multiples of three), and so on. Once we have done this for all primes less than `N`, the unmarked numbers that remain will be prime.

Implement this algorithm.

Bonus: Create a generator that produces primes indefinitely (that is, without taking `N` as an input).

#### Problem 245

This problem was asked by Yelp.

You are given an array of integers, where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be jumped going forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps you must take in order to get from the start to the end of the array.

For example, given `[6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9]`, you should return `2`, as the optimal solution involves jumping from `6` to `5`, and then from `5` to `9`.

#### Problem 246

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Given a list of words, determine whether the words can be chained to form a circle. A word `X` can be placed in front of another word `Y` in a circle if the last character of `X` is same as the first character of `Y`.

For example, the words `['chair', 'height', 'racket', 'touch', 'tunic']` can form the following circle: `chair -> racket -> touch -> height -> tunic -> chair`.

Given a binary tree, determine whether or not it is height-balanced. A height-balanced binary tree can be defined as one in which the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.
