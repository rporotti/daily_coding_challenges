#### Problem 220

This problem was asked by Square.

In front of you is a row of N coins, with values `v_1, v_2, ..., v_n`.

You are asked to play the following game. You and an opponent take turns choosing either the first or last coin from the row, removing it from the row, and receiving the value of the coin.

Write a program that returns the maximum amount of money you can win with certainty, if you move first, assuming your opponent plays optimally.

Let's define a "sevenish" number to be one which is either a power of `7`, or the sum of unique powers of `7`. The first few sevenish numbers are `1, 7, 8, 49`, and so on. Create an algorithm to find the `n`th sevenish number.

Given an absolute pathname that may have `.` or `..` as part of it, return the shortest standardized path.

For example, given `/usr/bin/../bin/./scripts/../`, return `/usr/bin/`.

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Typically, an implementation of in-order traversal of a binary tree has `O(h)` space complexity, where `h` is the height of the tree. Write a program to compute the in-order traversal of a binary tree using `O(1)` space.

#### Problem 224

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a sorted array, find the smallest positive integer that is not the sum of a subset of the array.

For example, for the input `[1, 2, 3, 10]`, you should return `7`.

Do this in `O(N)` time.

#### Problem 225

This problem was asked by Bloomberg.

There are `N` prisoners standing in a circle, waiting to be executed. The executions are carried out starting with the `k`th person, and removing every successive `k`th person going clockwise until there is no one left.

Given `N` and `k`, write an algorithm to determine where a prisoner should stand in order to be the last survivor.

For example, if `N = 5` and `k = 2`, the order of executions would be `[2, 4, 1, 5, 3]`, so you should return `3`.

Bonus: Find an `O(log N)` solution if `k = 2`.

You come across a dictionary of sorted words in a language you've never seen before. Write a program that returns the correct order of letters in this language.

For example, given `['xww', 'wxyz', 'wxyw', 'ywx', 'ywz']`, you should return `['x', 'z', 'w', 'y']`.

Boggle is a game played on a `4 x 4` grid of letters. The goal is to find as many words as possible that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent letters in the grid, using each cell at most once. Given a game board and a dictionary of valid words, implement a Boggle solver.

Given a list of numbers, create an algorithm that arranges them in order to form the largest possible integer. For example, given `[10, 7, 76, 415]`, you should return `77641510`.

#### Problem 229

This problem was asked by Flipkart.

Snakes and Ladders is a game played on a `10 x 10` board, the goal of which is get from square `1` to square `100`. On each turn players will roll a six-sided die and move forward a number of spaces equal to the result. If they land on a square that represents a snake or ladder, they will be transported ahead or behind, respectively, to a new square.

Find the smallest number of turns it takes to play snakes and ladders.

For convenience, here are the squares representing snakes and ladders, and their outcomes:

```
snakes = {16: 6, 48: 26, 49: 11, 56: 53, 62: 19, 64: 60, 87: 24, 93: 73, 95: 75, 98: 78}
ladders = {1: 38, 4: 14, 9: 31, 21: 42, 28: 84, 36: 44, 51: 67, 71: 91, 80: 100}
```
