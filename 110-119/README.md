#### Problem 110

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a binary tree, return all paths from the root to leaves.

For example, given the tree

```
   1
  / \
 2   3
    / \
   4   5
```

it should return `[[1, 2], [1, 3, 4], [1, 3, 5]]`.

Given a word W and a string S, find all starting indices in S which are anagrams of W.

For example, given that W is "ab", and S is "abxaba", return 0, 3, and 4.

#### Problem 112

This problem was asked by Twitter.

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree. Assume that each node in the tree also has a pointer to its parent.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

#### Problem 113

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a string of words delimited by spaces, reverse the words in string. For example, given "hello world here", return "here world hello"

Follow-up: given a mutable string representation, can you perform this operation in-place?

#### Problem 114

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a string and a set of delimiters, reverse the words in the string while maintaining the relative order of the delimiters. For example, given "hello/world:here", return "here/world:hello"

Follow-up: Does your solution work for the following cases: "hello/world:here/", "hello//world:here"

#### Problem 115

This problem was asked by Google.

Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

#### Problem 116

This problem was asked by Jane Street.

Generate a finite, but an arbitrarily large binary tree quickly in `O(1)`.

That is, `generate()` should return a tree whose size is unbounded but finite.

#### Problem 117

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a binary tree, return the level of the tree with minimum sum.

#### Problem 118

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a sorted list of integers, square the elements and give the output in sorted order.

For example, given `[-9, -2, 0, 2, 3]`, return `[0, 4, 4, 9, 81]`.

#### Problem 119

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a set of closed intervals, find the smallest set of numbers that covers all the intervals. If there are multiple smallest sets, return any of them.

For example, given the intervals `[0, 3], [2, 6], [3, 4], [6, 9]`, one set of numbers that covers all these intervals is `{3, 6}`.
